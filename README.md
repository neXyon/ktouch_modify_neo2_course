ktouch_modify_neo2_course
=========================

This python script modifies the "Deutsches Neo 2" ktouch course to your keyboard layout and based on a corpus that you have to download from https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/de/download/German.
You can generate lessons in other languages, however the titles of lessons and many of the later full text lessons will remain German if you don't modify the script accordingly.

How To
------

You need to modify the first part of the script to at least enter your keyboard layout and the corpus you use.
See the instructions in the comments of the script.
Note: Apart from python3 you will need numpy and pandas.
